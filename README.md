# Perceptual Attributes
The goal of this work is to use distinct tools to define groups in user generated content. 
This is, to find groups that by analyzing their reviews on an entity, such as a movie, product or service; agree on the importance of certain features. 
Features can be extracted explicitly by use of a Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis approach, or in a more abstract way such as Vector Embeddings (doc2vec). 
Then the groups are generated via clustering algorithms, possibly Subspace Clustering, to deal with the high-dimentionality of the data.
